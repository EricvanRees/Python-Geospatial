This documentation contains a URL to a 16-page PDF with documentation of the tool that is recommended to read before getting started. \n",

    "In order to install the ArcGIS-R bridge, you need to run a script called “Install R bindings” from the Catalog window ArcMap to install the tool. In Pro, you need to select the Projects pane and add the toolbox through Toolbox -> Add Toolbox, open it and run it from there. "

    "\n",
    "Depending on if you´re using ArcMap or Pro, you need to use a corresponding 32-bit or 64-bit version of RStudio. If RStudio prompts you to use a different version than the one you´re using now, there´s no need to install a second version of RStudio, but instead change the current version to the preferred one by choosing Tools -> Global Options and clicking “change” on the right where it says “R Version”, which is the first option of the menu. Such a change may be necessary as RStudio’s default version corresponds to the installed version of R and not ArcMap or Pro. If you´re running ArcMap and Pro on the same machine and use the ArcGIS-R bridge, this can come in handy.\n"
