It describes how to create a NumPy array from a shapefile and interact with the attribute table data inside of it, making simple data queries. The goal is to get familiar with NumPy arrays and related Python syntax and functionality.</b>\n",

    "Although the dataset includes multiple files, the only file that’s used in this tutorial is an Esri shapefile called LondonBoroughs.shp. It´s recommended to download a copy of this dataset in a separate folder on your hard drive and inspect the shapefile in ArcMap/ArcCatalog, especially the contents of its attribute table. As you can see, the geometry consists of a number of polygons that together form the different communities of London. The attribute file consists of all borough names and different columns with numerical data. Next, we´ll introduce some Python syntax to work with this data in NumPy.\n",

NumPy lets you work with multidimensional data, making it possible to work with data in a better structure and let you manipulate that structure as well. For example, our new NumPy array can be used to list all column values, by specifying a specific header name. The result is a Python list containing all column values with header Pop_2001."
