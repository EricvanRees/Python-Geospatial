    "<h1>How to Create pandas DataFrames from Shapefile Attribute Data</h1>\n",
    "Pandas DataFrame objects are comparable to Excel spreadsheet or a relational database table. They come from the R programming language and are the most important data object in the Python pandas library. They are handy for data manipulation and analysis, which is why you might want to convert a shapefile attribute table into a pandas DataFrame. Unfortunately, ArcMap offers no such functionality and pandas itself doesn´t know what to do with spatial data. However, there are various workarounds available to create DataFrame objects from shapefiles attribute tables. A few of them are covered below.\n",

    "The quickest and easiest option to create a DataFrame from a shapefile is by using GeoPandas, a Python library for working with geospatial data. GeoPandas inherits the standard pandas methods for indexing and selecting data and adds geographical operations as spatial joins and merges. Geopandas can read almost any vector-based spatial data format, including Esri shapefile so that with only two lines of code, you can place all rows and columns into a GeoDataFrame, the library´s data object that is modeled after the pandas DataFrame. This GeoDataFrame also lists a Geometry column containing points for each row (feature):"
